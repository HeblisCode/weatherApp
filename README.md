# Weather App

### [Live Preview](https://hebliscode.github.io/weatherApp/) <br>

Fully functional weather app built with Openweather API. The app shows you the current weather, the weather for the next 48hr and for the next 7 days.
The background and theme of the app change based on the weather and the time of the day. Once you search for a specific city, the program stores it using localStorage and automatically displays the weather for that city on your next use.
There are also two buttons on the header: one changes the temperature scale between celsius and fahrenheit, the other refresh the weather data.
Finally, the app is fully responsive and it's my first try with the "mobile CSS first" approach.<br>

### Future Changes <br>

- add a today and tomorrow section to display the hourly weather in a more readable way
- add extra infos about the day in the daily weather section after the user clicks it
- fully implement keyboard for mobile users
